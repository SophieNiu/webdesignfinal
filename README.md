# Suicidal Rate Visualization

## Dataset 
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016/data

Columns: 
- Year 
- Country
  - number of suicides
  - Suicide rate
  - Population
  - GDP
  - GDP per capita
  - HDI (human development index)
- People
  - Age group
  - Generation (based on age group avg)
  - Sex


## Final Deliverable 
- Simple page 
  - Text: problem statement, story we want to tell, the impact, the interpretation
  - Infovis  (d3.js)

- TBD factors: 
  - [ ] How many visuals (d3, tableau?)
  - [ ] Focus on what aspect? 
  - [ ] Do we need any other dataset?
  - [ ] What layout?

## Domain tasks:  
Here is the list of questions that we would like to explore: 
  - What’s the relationship between GDP per capita and suicidal rate? 
  - Are there any differences in suicidal rates among different sex in different countries? 
  - Any trend in suicidal people’s age and sex throughout the years? 
  - Based on the years, have the suicidal rate improved?
  - According to generation, is there any correlation between high suicidal rate parents and children? 
  - What’s the relationship between suicide rate and HDI?  
  - How does the suicidal rate change over the years?
  - How does the suicidal rate relate to the economic situation?
  - Is age a good indicator of the suicidal rate?
  
- [x] Here is the final three questions that we would like to answer with the vis: 
   1. What’s the relationship between continents and suicidal rate? 
   2. How suicide rates change in different age groups?
   3. What’s the relationship between gpd per capita and suicidal rate? 
   4. What’s the relationship between gender and suicidal rate?

## Meeting Todo
### 11/15 (Fri)  meeting: 
- [x] Select 3 questions from the list to focus on 
- [x] Decide on the potential visual presentations of the tasks/ data
- [x] Number of visual & interaction
- [ ] Find & set the texts based on the questions
- [x] Decide the layout (responsive?)
 
### After 11/15 meeting: 
- [ ] Simple html setup
- [ ] Text finding and creation
- [ ] Bubble j3 chart 
- [ ] Streamgraph
- [ ] Line Chart
