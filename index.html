      <h1>Suicide Current Issue</h1>

      <br>
      <br>
      <p>On October 14, 2019, there was a message blew the whole internet. Sulli, one of the famous K-Pop celebrities committed suicide. Many were shocked. Many miss her today. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        One month and ten days later, Goo Hara, a 28-year-old K-Pop Star who is a good friend of Sulli, was also found dead in her home. After several days of investigation, Police decalred her death cause as suicide. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Suicide happens certainly not just among celebrities, it happens ubiquitously in terms of age groups, genders, countries. According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/suicide#tab=tab_1" style ="color: black">World Health Organization (WHO)</a>, there are about <span style="color:#f43e06; font-weight: bold;">800,000</span> people die by suicide every year, which is about one person per <span style="color:#eb3c70; font-weight: bold;">40 seconds</span>. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Also, about every committed suicide, there is an average of <span style="color:#12a182; font-weight: bold;">20 attempts</span>. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Suicide is a severe issue that people rarely talk about in the public. Thus, we would like to raise the awareness to the suicide issue by showing the relationship between suicide rates with multiple demographic and economical factors, such as age, sex, and countries based on the WHO suicide dataset.

        <p>
         From the graph above, we see several patterns in this data:
          <ul>
            <li>The <span style="color:#eb3c70; font-weight: bold;">male </span>people live in <span style="color:#12a182; font-weight: bold;">Russia</span>, aged <span style="color:#f43e06; font-weight: bold;">35-54 </span>have the highest risk of committing  suicide.</li>
            <li>There is a large amount of people committed suicide at their <span style="color:#346c9c; font-weight: bold;">35-54.</span></li>
            <li>There is a much more <span style="color:#eb3c70; font-weight: bold;">male </span> committed suicide than female in 2015.</li>

      <p>
        According to the global data, in the year of 1985 to 2016, the suicide number had increased among all age groups. Specifically, a larger number of suicides were committed within the 35-54-year-old group, closely followed by people 55-74-year-old. People 5-14 and 75+ are less likely to commit suicide.

      <div class="Gender-Continent">
        <p>Among all the regions, Europe has the highest suicide rate, while Africa and North America have the lowest suicide rates. Comparing between females and male. Male in all continents has triple to quadruple of the average suicide rate than female.

      <h2 id="conclusion_title">Conclusion</h2>
      <div class="conclusion" id ='conclusion'>
        
        <p> Overall, we found that middle aged male in the age of <span style="color:#f43e06; font-weight: bold;">35 to 54</span>, who lives in <span style="color:#12a182; font-weight: bold;">Europe </span>has the largest potential to commit suicide.</p>
        
        <p>There are also <b>limitations</b> in our conclusion: The dataset is not complete in the sense that there are more Europe observations across the years and limited observation from other continents. For example, the dataset does not have any observations from China and India. In addition, there are observation gaps between years such as for Cuba, we only have observations from year 1992 to 2015.  </p>
          <br>
          <p>our dataset collected observations from <span style="color:#bec936; font-weight: bold;">1985 to 2016</span>, which is not up-to-date.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>It is difficult to live as an adult in the world. We have to face many issues, challenges, and downtimes. However, death would not be a way to solve any of the life challenges. Instead, seeking for help from your companions could together sort things out. We believe that with the data shown here, we can raise more awareness towards suicidal prevention actions. If you find yourself or any of your friends have suicidal thoughts or attempts, please never ignore it or make fun of them and seek help ASAP. </p>
